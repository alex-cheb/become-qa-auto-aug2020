1.  Create merge conflict and resolve it
git checkout -b conflict_b
echo "Lorem ipsum" >> conflict.txt
git add conflict.txt
git commit -m "Added a conflict.txt file"
echo "new text" >> conflict.txt
git commit -am "Updated conflict.txt"
git checkout master
echo "Added from master" >> conflict.txt
git add conflict.txt
git commit -m "Updated conflict.txt in master branch"
git merge conflict_b
# CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in conflict.txt
# Auto-merging conflict.txt
# Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
echo "resolving conflict" >> conflict.txt
git add conflict.txt
git commit -m "Made changes to resolve conflict"

2. Create branch, push it to remote with different name, delete it from remote only
git checkout -b hometask1_2
git push -u origin hometask1_2:ht1_2
git branch -vv
git push origin -d ht1_2
